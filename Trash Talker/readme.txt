This is a project done as part of the Bolt Iot Internship.
It is caleed as the Trash talker
It is a simple project which sends an sms to the user when the trash is full so that waste management is more efficient.

The .ino file is the arduino ide file written in arduino programming.
The .py file is used to fetch the bolt details using the program.

It's essentially a setup which uses the popular Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04), the Bolt Wi-Fi module, and an Arduino Uno to measure how much of the trash can has filled up. Once above a threshold, it sends an SMS to Userto check the trashcan and hence help save the olfactory systems of the entire company.
